# DP-050-Migrating-SQL-Workloads-to-Azure

During this course, the students will first explore the preparation steps that are required to help with a sucessful Data Modernization Project, and the tools that can help support them in the various stages of such a project. They will then explore the different methods of migrating SQL workloads to a range of different SQL Services that run in Azure.

The following is a summary of the lab objectives for each module:

## Lab 1 - Introducing Data Platform Modernization

The students will use the information gained in this module to demonstrate an understanding of Data Platform modernization, and why and how organizations should undertake a modernization project at a high level. They will demonstrate how to determine the cost of moving to Azure. They will also gather information about the environment that they are working on. Students will finally determine a data platform modernization strategy that should be used for a given scenario.

## Lab 2 - Choosing the right tools for Data Migrations

The students will use two tools in the prescribed Data Platform Modernization stages to perform a discovery of the environment in an automated way. They will also Identify any pre migration compatibility issues and define a plan on how to address the issues before performing a migration of an on-premises server. Finally, they will assess how a workload will perform on a target version of Azure SQL Database.

## Lab 3 - Migrate SQL Workloads to Azure Virtual Machines

The students will configure the environments for a data migration, including the provisioning of a SQL Server VM on Azure.
They will then perform a data migration to SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines by transfering databases from a SQL Server 2008 R2 environment using Data Migration Assistant (DMA).

## Lab 4 - Migrate SQL Workloads to SQL Database

The students will perform an offline migration using the Azure Database Migration Assistant(DMA) from an on-premises SQL Server to an Azure SQL Database. Prior to this the student will determine the right SQL Server instance option in Azure to migrate to. They will finalize the migration by using a migration tool to load and move data into the Azure SQL Database.

## Lab 5 - Migrate SQL Workloads to SQL Database Managed Instance

The students will initially evaluate the migration process that they will use to migrate from an on-premises SQL Server to an Azure SQL Database Managed instance. They will then perform an online migration using the Azure Database Migration Service. They will also migrate the data and load it into the managed instance before checking for application compatibility for an application that accesses the database. This lab is in a simulated environment.
