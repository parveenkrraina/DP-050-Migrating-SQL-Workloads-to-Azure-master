# DP 050 - Migrating SQL Workloads to Azure
# Lab 5 - Migrate SQL Workloads to SQL Database Managed Instance

**In development**

>**IMPORTANT**: The creation of an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance can take many hours. We are currently working on a way to deliver a lab that will enable you to see how to perform a migration to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance in a more timely manner. In the meantime, you can explore how to perform a migration at the following [Microsoft Cloud Workshop](https://handsonlabs.microsoft.com/handsonlabs/SelfPacedLabs/?storyId=story://Content-Private/content/w-sqlmi-a/2migrate/migrate), which takes approximately 45 minutes. However, the trainer has no control over the management of this lab environment.

>**IMPORTANT**: SQL Managed instances consume a significant amount of Azure resources, targeted towards our business and enterprise customers, and it is **not recommended** that you create this on a personal subscription. If you should do this, you should monitor your Azure spending limits.
